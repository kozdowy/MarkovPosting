And if the snow buries my...
My neighborhood

And if my parents are crying,
Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours
Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours

You climb out the chimney
And meet me in the middle
The middle of the town
And since there's no one else around,
We let our hair grow long and forget all we used to know
Then our skin gets thicker from living out in the snow

You change all the lead sleeping in my head
As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn...

Then, we tried to name our babies
But we forgot all the names that,
The names we used to know
But sometimes,
We remember our bedrooms and our parent's bedrooms and the bedrooms of our friends
Then we think of our parents...
Well, whatever happened to them?!

You change all the lead sleeping in my head to gold
As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn
It's the song I've been trying to sing...

Purify the colors, purify my mind
Purify the colors, purify my mind
And spread the ashes of the colors over this heart of mine!

Alexander, our older brother
Set out for a great adventure
He tore our images out of his pictures
He scratched our names out of all his letters

Our mother should've just named you Laika...

Come on, Alex. You can do it!
Come on, Alex. There's nothing to it!
If you want something, don't ask for nothing!
If you want nothing, don't ask for something!

Our mother should've just named you Laika...
It's for your own good
It's for the neighborhood...
The neighborhood!

Our older brother bit by a vampire
For a year, we caught his tears in a cup
And now we're gonna make him drink it
Come on, Alex. Don't die or dry up!

Our mother should've just named you Laika
It's for your own good
It's for the neighborhood...
The neighborhood!

When daddy comes home, you always start a fight
So the neighbors can dance in the police disco lights

The police disco lights
Now the neighbors can dance!
The police disco lights
Now the neighbors can dance!

Hey! the street lights all burnt out 
une année sans lumiere 
je monte un cheval 
qui porte des oeilleres 
hey! my eyes are shooting sparks 
la nuit, mes yeux t'eclairent 
ne dis pas à ton père 
qu'il porte des oeilleres 
hey, your old man should know 
if you see a shadow, there's something there

I woke up with the power out, not really somethin to shout about. ice 
has covered up my parents hands, don't have any dreams don't have any 
plans. i went out into the night, i went out to find some light. kids 
are swingin from the power lines, nobody's home so nobody minds 
i woke up on the darkest night, neighbors all were shouting that they 
found the light - "we found the light." - shadows jumpin' all over my 
walls, some of them big, some of them small. i went out into the night 
i went out to pick a fight with anyone. light a candle for the kids, 
jesus christ don't keep it hid! 
ice has covered up my parents eyes, don't know how to see, don't know 
how to cry. growin' up in some strange storm, nobody's cold, nobody's 
warm. i went out into the night, i went out to find some light. kids 
are dyin' out in the snow, look at them go - look at them go! 
and the power's out in the heart of man, take it from your heart put 
it in your hand. what's the plan? what's the plan? is it a dream? is 
it a lie? i think i'll let you deceide. just light a candle for the 
kids, jesus christ don't keep it hid! cause nothing's hid, from us 
kids! you ain't foolin' nobody - with the lights out! and the power's 
out in the heart of man, take it from your heart put it in your hand. 
and there's something wrong in the heart of man, you take it from your 
heart and put it in your hand! where'd you go?!

I am waitin' 'til I don't know when, 
cause I'm sure it's gonna happen then. 
Time keeps creepin' through the neighborhood, 
killing old folks, wakin' up babies 
just like we knew it would. 

All the neighbors are startin' up a fire, 
burning all the old folks the witches and the liars. 
My eyes are covered by the hands of my unborn kids, 
but my heart keeps watchin' 
through the skin of my eyelids. 

They say a watched pot won't ever boil, 
well I closed my eyes and nothin' changed, 
just some water getting hotter in the flames. 

It's not a lover I want no more, 
and it's not heaven I'm pining for, 
but there's some spirit I used to know, 
that's been drowned out by the radio! 

They say a watched pot won't ever boil, 
you can't raise a baby on motor oil, 
just like a seed down in the soil 
you gotta give it time

They say it fades if you let it, love was made to forget it. i carved 
your name across my eyelids, you pray for rain i pray for blindness. 
if you still want me, please forgive me, the crown of love is not upon me. 
if you still want me, please forgive me, because the spark is not within me. 
i snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
the only thing that you keep changin' is your name. my love keeps 
growin' still the same, just like cancer, and you won't give me a 
straight answer! 
if you still want me, please forgive me, the crown of love has fallen from me. 
if you still want me, please forgive me, because your hands are not upon me. 
i shrugged them off before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
the pains of love, and they keep growin', in my heart there's flowers 
growin' on the grave of our old love, since you gave me a straight 
answer. 
if you still want me, please forgive me, the crown of love is not upon me. 
if you still want me, please forgive me, because the spark is not within me. 
it's not within me. 
it's not within me. 
you gotta be the one. you gotta be the way. your name is the only 
word, the only word that i can say!

Somethin’ filled up
my heart with nothin’,
someone told me not to cry.

But now that I’m older,
my heart’s colder,
and I can see that it’s a lie.

Children wake up,
hold your mistake up,
before they turn the summer into dust.

If the children don’t grow up,
our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up.
We’re just a million little god’s causin rain storms
Turnin’ every good thing to rust.

I guess we’ll just have to adjust.

With my lighnin’ bolts a glowin’
I can see where I am goin’ to be
when the reaper he reaches and touches my hand.

With my lighnin’ bolts a glowin’
I can see where I am goin’
With my lighnin’ bolts a glowin’
I can see where I am go-goin’

You better look out below!

Haïti, mon pays,
Wounded mother I'll never see
Ma famille set me free.
Throw my ashes into the sea.

Mes cousins jamais nés
Hantent les nuits de Duvalier.
Rien n'arrte nos esprits.
Guns can't kill what soldiers can't see.

In the forest we are hiding,
Unmarked graves where flowers grow.
Hear the soldiers angry yelling,
In the river we will go.

Tous les morts-nés forment une armée
Soon we will reclaim the earth.
All the tears and all the bodies
Bring about our second birth

Haïti, never free,
N'aie pas peur de sonner l'alarme.
Tes enfants son partis,
In those days their blood was still warm.

Sleeping is giving in, no matter what the time is. sleeping is giving 
in, so lift those heavy eyelids. 
people say that you'll die faster than without water. but we know it's 
just a lie, scare your son and scare your daughter. 
people say that your dreams are the only things that save ya. 
come on baby in our dreams, we can live our misbehaviour. 
everytime you close your eyes lies, lies! 
people try and hide the night underneath the covers. 
people try and hide the light underneath the covers. 
come on hide your lovers underneath the covers. 
come on hide your lovers underneath the covers. 
hidin' from your brothers underneath the covers, come on hide your 
lovers underneath the covers. 
people say that you'll die faster than without water, but we know it's 
just a lie, scare your son, scare your daughter 
now here's the sun, it's alright! now here's the moon, it's alright! 
now here's the sun, it's alright! now here's the moon, it's alright! 
but everytime you close your eyes, lies!

I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside
And i can fall asleep

My family tree's
Losing all its leaves
Crashing towards the driver's seat
The lightning bolt made enough heat 
To melt the street beneath your feet

Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
My whole life
I've been learning

I walked down to the ocean
After waking from a nightmare
No moon, no pale reflection
Black Mirror, Black Mirror

Shot by a security camera
You can't watch your own image
And also look yourself in the eye
Black Mirror, Black Mirror, Black Mirror

I know a time is coming
All words will lose their meaning
Please show me something that isn't mine
But mine is the only kind that I relate to
Le miroir casse
The mirror casts mon reflet partour
Black Mirror, Black Mirror, Black Mirror

The black mirror knows no reflection
It knows not pride or vanity
It cares not about your dreams
It cares not for your pyramid schemes
Their names are never spoken
The curse is never broken
The curse is never broken

Un! Deux! Trois! Dis: Miroir Noir!
Black Mirror!
Un! Deux! Trois! Dis: Miroir Noir!
Black Mirror!

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me where them bombs will fall
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me where them bombs will fall

Black Mirror!
Black Mirror!
Black Mirror!

Every night my dream's the same
Same old city with a different name
Men are coming to take me away
I don't know why, but I know I can't stay

There's a weight that's pressing down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can't swim across a river so deep
They know my name cause I told it to them
But they don't know where and they don't know 
When it's coming, when it's coming

There's a fear I keep so deep
Knew its name since before I could speak
Aaaaah Aaaaah Aaaaah Aaaaah
They know my name cause I told it to them
But they don't know where and they don't know
When its coming, oh when but its coming

Keep the car running

If some night I don't come home
Please don't think I've left you alone
The same place animals go when they die
You can't climb across a mountain so high
The same city where I go when I sleep
You can't swim across a river so deep
They know my name cause I told it to them
But they don't know where
And they don't know
When it's coming, oh when is it coming?

Keep the car running
Keep the car running
Keep the car running

A vial of hope and a vial of pain
In the light they both looked the same
Poured them out on into the world
On every boy and every girl

It's in the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
If the Neon Bible is right

Take the poison of your age
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
What I know is what you know is right
In the city it's the only light
It's the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
If the Neon Bible is right

Oh God! Well look at you now!
Oh! You lost it, but you don't know how!
In the light of a golden calf
Oh God! I had to laugh!

Take the poison of your age
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
It was wrong but you said it was right
In the future I will read at night

It's the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
If the Neon Bible is true

The king's taken back the throne
The useless seed is sown
When they say they're cutting off the phone
I tell 'em you're not home

No place to hide
You were fighting as a soldier on their side
You're still a soldier in your mind
Though nothing's on the line

You say it's money that we need
As if we're only mouths to feed
I know no matter what you say
There are some debts you'll never pay

Working for the Church while your family dies
You take what they give you and you keep it inside
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home
Hear the solider groan, "We'll go at it alone"

I can taste the fear
Lift me up and take me out of here
Don't wanna fight, don't wanna die
Just wanna hear you cry

Who's gonna throw the very first stone?
Oh! Who's gonna reset the bone?
Walking with your head in a sling
Wanna hear the solider sing:
"Been working for the Church while my family dies
Your little baby sister's gonna lose her mind
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home"
Hear the soldier groan "We'll go at it alone.

I can taste your fear
It's gonna lift you up and take you out of here
And the bone shall never heal
I care not if you kneel

We can't find you now
But they're gonna get the money back somehow
And when you finally disappear
We'll just say you were never here

Working for the church while your life falls apart
Singing halleluiah with the fear in your heart
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home
Hear the solider groan, "We'll go at it alone"
Hear the solider groan, "We'll go at it alone"

We can reach the sea
They won't follow me
Shadows they fear the sun
We'll make it if we run!

Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent

Left my name with the border guards
A name that I don't need
Ce sera un long voyage
Sur les vagues de l'oubli

Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent

Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me
For you
For me
It's always for you

Stop now before it's too late
Your lover was for hire
Have you noticed he's been late
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me
For you
For me
It's always for you

The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet

In an ocean of noise
I first heard your voice
Ringing like a bell
As if I had a choice, oh well!

Left in the morning
While you were fast asleep
Into an ocean of violence
A world of empty streets

You've got your reasons
And me I've got mine
But all the reasons I gave
Were just lies to buy myself some time

In an ocean of noise
I first heard your voice
Now who hear among us
Still believes in choice?
Not I!

No way of knowing
What any man will do
An ocean of violence
Between me and you

You've got your reasons
And me I've got mine
But all the reasons I gave
Were just lies to buy myself some time

I'm gonna work it out
Cause time wont work it out
I'm gonna work it out
Cause time wont work it our for you
I'm gonna work it on out

I'm serving time
All for a crime I did commit
You want the truth?
You know I'd do it all again
Left for dead
Heaven is only in my head!

I heard a voice
Calling from down inside the well
"See that silver shine?"
She said to come claim what was mine
So down I fell
Down into the water black
My prison cell
Only the moon was shining back!

If I seem lost, well I weighted the cost
And chose my crime
Now it's mine all mine!

I heard the voice
Calling from just outside the well
She said, "You fool, now that you know your end is near
You always fall for what you desire or what you fear!"

Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
If you leave the ships are gonna wreck
Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet

I don't wanna work in a building downtown
No I don't wanna work in a building downtown
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Cause the planes keep crashing always two by two
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
No I don't wanna see when the planes hit the ground

I don't wanna work in a building downtown
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
Parking their cars in the underground
Their voices when they scream, well they make no sound
I wanna see the cities rust
And the troublemakers riding on the back of the bus

Dear God, I'm a good Christian man
In your glory, I know you understand
That you gotta work hard and you gotta get paid
My girl's 13 but she don't act her age
She can sing like a bird in a cage
O Lord, if you could see her when she's up on that stage!

You know that I'm a God-fearing man
You know that I'm a God-fearing man
But I just gotta know if it's part of your plan
To seat my daughters there by your right hand
I know that you'll do what's right, Lord
For they are the lanterns and you are the light

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Tell me what to say
I'll be your mouthpiece!

Into the light of a bridge that burns 
As I drive from the city with the money that I earned
Into the black of a starless sky
I'm staring into nothing
and I'm asking you why
Lord, will you make her a star
So the world can see who you really are?

Little girl, you're old enough to understand
That you'll always be a stranger in a strange, strange land
The men are gonna come when you're fast asleep
So you better just stay close and hold onto me
If my little mocking bird don't sing
Then daddy won't buy her no diamond ring

Dear God, would you send me a child?
Oh! God, would you send me a child
Cause I wanna put it up on the TV screen
So the world can see what your true word means
Lord, would you send me a sign
Cause I just gotta know if I'm wasting my time!

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Now the war is won
How come nothing tastes good?

You're such a sensitive child!
Oh! You're such a sensitive child!
I know you're tired but it's alright
I just need you to sing for me tonight
You're gonna have your day in the sun
You know God loves the sensitive ones

Oh! My little bird in a cage!
Oh! My little bird in a cage!
I need you to get up for me, up on that stage
And show the men that you're old for your age
Now ain't the time for fear
But if you don't take it, it'll disappear!

Oh! My little mocking bird sing!
Oh! My little mocking bird sing!
I need you to get up on that stage for me, honey
And show the men it's not about the money

Wanna hold a mirror up to the world
So that they can see themselves inside my little girl!

Do you know where I was at your age?
Any idea where I was at your age?
I was working downtown for the minimum wage
And I'm not gonna let you just throw it all away!
I'm through being cute, I'm through being nice
O tell me, Lord, am I the Antichrist?!

Don't wanna hear the noises on TV
Don't want the salesmen coming after me
Don't wanna live in my father's house no more
Don't want it faster, I don't want it free
Don't wanna show you what they done to me
Don't wanna live in my father's house no more
Don't wanna choose black or blue
Don't wanna see what they done to you
Don't wanna live in my father's house no more

Cause the tide is high
And it's rising still
And I don't wanna see it at my windowsill

Don't wanna give 'em my name and address
Don't wanna see what happens next
Don't wanna live in my father's house no more
Don't wanna live with my father's debt
You can't forgive what you can't forget
Don't wanna live in my father's house no more
Don't wanna fight in a holy war
Don't want the salesmen knocking at my door
I don't wanna live in America no more

Cause the tide is high
And it's rising still
And I don't wanna see it at my windowsill

MTV, what have you done to me?
Save my soul, set me free!
Set me free! What have you done to me?
I can't breathe! I can't see!
World War III, when are you coming for me?
Been kicking up sparks, we set the flames free
The windows are locked now so what'll it be?
A house on fire or a rising sea?

Why is the night so still?
Why did I take the pill?
Because I don't wanna see it at my windowsill

Don't wanna see it at my windowsill 
Don't wanna see it at my windowsill 
Don't wanna see it at my windowsill

We know a place where no planes go
We know a place where no ships go
Hey!
No cars go
Hey!
No cars go
Where we know

We know a place where no spaceships go
We know a place where no subs go
Hey!
No cars go
Hey!
No cars go
Where we know
Hey!
Us kids know
Hey! 
No cars go

Go!
No go!

Between the click of the light and the start of the dream
Between the click of the light and the start of the dream

Little babies?
Let's go!

Women and children?
Let's go!

Old folks?
Let's go!

Don't know where we're going

My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

I'm standing on a stage
Of fear and self-doubt
It's a hollow play
But they'll clap anyway

My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key

I'm living in an age
That calls darkness light
Though my language is dead
Still the shapes fill my head

I'm living in an age
Whose name I don't know
Though the fear keeps me moving
Still my heart beats so slow

My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key
My body is a

My body is a cage
We take what we're given
Just because you've forgotten
That don't mean you're forgiven

I'm living in an age
That screams my name at night
But when I get to the doorway
There's no one in sight

I'm living in an age
That laughs
When I'm dancing
With the one I love
But my mind holds the key

You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key

Set my spirit free
Set my spirit free
Set my body free
Set my body free

Set my spirit free
Set my body free

In the suburbs I
I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys we're leavin'

You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting
In a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore

But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

Kids wanna be so hard
But in my dreams we're still screamin' and runnin' through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothin' at all
Meant nothin' at all
It meant nothin

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand?
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young
I wanna hold her hand
And show her some beauty
Before all this damage is done

But if it's too much to ask, it's too much to ask
Then send me a son

Under the overpass
In the parking lot we're still waiting
It's already past
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
Cause it's already past
It's already, already past

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

I'm movin' past the feeling
I'm movin' past the feeling

In my dreams we're still screamin'
We're still screamin'
We're still screamin'

If the businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "can we still be friends? "

If I was scared... I would
And if I was bored... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears no clothes
But they bow down to him anyway
'Cause it's better than being alone

If I was scared... I would
And if I was bored... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

Now you're knocking at my door
Saying please come out with us tonight
But I would rather be alone
Than pretend I feel alright

If the businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "can we still be friends? "

If I was scared... I would
And if I was pure... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

Now I'm ready to start

If I was scared... I would
And if I was pure... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

Now I'm ready to start

Now I'm ready to start
I would rather be wrong
Than live in the shadows of your song
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start

Now I'm ready to start
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
You're not sure
You open the door
And step out into the dark

Now I'm ready

So I wait my turn, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like

So I wait in line, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Something don't feel right

Like a record that's skipping
I'm a modern man
And the clock keeps ticking
I'm a modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like

In my dream I was almost there
Then they pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
They say we are the chosen few
But we waste it
And that's why we're still waiting
On a number from the modern man
Maybe when you're older you will understand
Why you don't feel right
Why you can't sleep at night now

In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man

Oh I had a dream I was dreaming
And I feel I'm losing the feeling
Makes me feel like
Like something don't feel right
I erase the number of the modern man
Want to break the mirror of the modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like

In my dream I was almost there
Then they pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
I know we are the chosen few
But we waste it
And that's why we're still waiting
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man

If it's alright
Then how come you can't sleep at night?
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man

I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man

Let's go downtown and watch the modern kids
Let's go downtown and talk to the modern kids
They will eat right out of your hand
Using great big words that they don't understand
They're singing:

Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo

They build it up just to burn it back down
They build it up just to burn it back down
The wind is blowing all the ashes around
Oh my dear God what is that horrible song they're singin'

Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo!
Rococo!

They seem wild but they are so tame
They seem wild but they are so tame
They're moving towards you with their colors all the same
They want to own you but they don't know what game they're playing

Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo!
Rococo!

(Rococo)
(Rococo)

Rococo!
Rococo!

(Rococo)
(Rococo)

Rococo!

Said your name, in an empty room
Said your name, in an empty room
Something I would never do

Said your name, in an empty room
Said your name, in an empty room
Something I would never do

I'm alone again

When I'm by myself
I can be myself
And my life is coming
But I don't know when

You were burning out, you're black and gray
You were burning out, you're black and gray
Something I would never say

I'm alone again

When I'm by myself
I can be myself
And my life is coming
But I don't know when

Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Moi j'attends, toi tu pars

Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Moi j'attends, toi tu pars

The summer that I broke my arm
I waited for your letter
I have no feeling for you now
Now that I know you better

I wish that I could have loved you then
Before our age was through
And before a world war does with us whatever it will do

Dreamt I drove home to Houston
On a highway that was underground
There was no light that we could see
As we listened to the sound
Of the engine failing

I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside of a private prison

You never trust a millionaire quoting the sermon on the mount
I used to think I was not like them but I'm beginning to have my doubts
My doubts about it

When you're hiding underground
The rain can't get you wet
But do you think your righteousness could pay the interest on your debt?
I have my doubts about it

I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside of a private prison

I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by and by as I hide inside of my private prison

You told us that
We were too young
Now that night's closing in
And in the half light
We run
Lock us up safe
And hide the key
But the night tears us loose
And in the half light
We're free

Strange how the half light
Can make a place new
You can't recognize me
And I can't recognize you

We run through these streets
That we know so well
And the houses hide so much
But in the half light
None of us can tell
They hide the ocean in a shell
The ocean in a shell

Our heads are just houses
Without enough windows
You say you hear human voices
But they're only echoes

They're only echoes
They're only echoes
Only echoes

[x3:]
We are not asleep,
We are in the streets

Now that San Francisco's gone,
I guess I'll just pack it in.
Wanna wash away my sins,
In the presence of my friends.

You and I we head back East,
To find a town where we can live.
Even in the half light,
We can see that something's gotta give.

When we watched the markets crash,
The promises we made were torn
Then my parents sent for me,
From out West where I was born.

Some people say, we've already lost,
But they're afraid to pay the cost for what we've lost.
Pay the cost for what we've lost

Now that you have left me here,
I will never raise my voice.
All the diamonds you have here,
In this home which has no life.

Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child.
Pray that God won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild.

Though we knew this day would come,
Still it took us by surprise.
In this town where I was born,
I now see through a dead man's eyes.

One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.

Let's go for a drive
And see the town tonight
There's nothing to do but I don't mind when I'm with you

This time's so strange
They built it to change
And while we're sleeping all the streets, they rearrange.

And my old friends, we were so different then
Before your war against the suburbs began
Before it began

And now the music divides
Us into tribes
You grew your hair so I grew mine
You said the past won't rest
Until we jump the fence
And leave it behind

And my old friends, I can remember when
You cut your hair
I never saw you again
Now the cities we live in
Could be distant stars
And I search for you
In every passing car

The night's so warm
Yeah, the night's so warm
I've been living in the shadows of your song
Living in the shadows of your song

In the suburbs I,
I learned to drive
And you told me we would never survive
So grab your mother's keys we leave tonight

But you started a war
That you can't win
They keep erasing all the streets we grew up in

Now the music divides
Us into tribes
You choose your side and I'll choose my side

All my old friends, they don't know me now
Oh-oh
All my old friends, are staring through me now
Oh-oh
All my old friends, they don't know me now
All my old friends, they don't know me now

All my old friends wait

One two three four!

Gonna make a record in the month of May
In the month of May, in the month of May
Gonna make a record in the month of May
When the violent wind blows the wires away

Month of May, it's a violent thing
In the city their hearts start to sing
Well, some people sing,
It sounds like they're screaming
Used to doubt it
But now I believe it

Month of May, everybody's in love
Then the city was hit from above
And just when I knew what I wanted to say
A violent wind blew the wires away

We were shocked in the suburbs

Now the kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Well, some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight
I said some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight

So young, so young
So much pain for someone so young, well
I know it's heavy, I know it ain't light
But how you gonna lift it with your arms folded tight?

First the built the road, then they built the town
That's why we're still driving around
And around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around

Two-thousand nine, two-thousand ten
Wanna make a record how I felt then
When we stood outside in the month of May
And watched the violent wind blow the wires away

If I die in the month of May
Let the wind take my body away, yeah
I wish I may, I wish I might
Don't lay me down there with my arms folded tight

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires, the wires away

All those wasted hours we used to know
Spent the summer staring out the window
The wind it takes you where it wants to go

First they built the road, then they built the town
That's why we're still driving around and around
And all we see
Are kids in buses longing to be free

Wasted hours, before we knew
Where to go, and what to do
Wasted hours that you make new
And turn into
A life that we can live

Some cities make you lose your head
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
And what was that line you said?

Wishing you were anywhere but here
You watch the life you're living disappear
And now I see
We're still kids in buses
Longing to be free

Wasted hours, before we knew
Where to go, and what to do
Wasted hours, that you make new
And turn into
A life that we can live

Here
In my place and time
And here in my own skin
I can finally begin
Let the century pass me by
Standing under night sky
Tomorrow means nothing

I was only a child then
Feeling barely alive when
I heard a song from the speaker of a passing car
And prayed to a dying star
The memory's fading
I can almost remember singing
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

We watched the end of the century
Compressed on a tiny screen
A dead star collapsing and we could see
That something was ending
Are you through pretending
We saw the signs in the suburbs?

You could never predict it
That it could see through you
Kasparov - Deep Blue 1996
Your mind's playing tricks now
Show is over so take a bow
We're living in the shadows of...
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

Hey
Put the cellphone down for a while
In the night there is something wild
Can you hear it breathing?
And hey
Put the laptop down for a while
In the night there is something wild
I feel it, it's leaving me

La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

I used to write
I used to write letters
I used to sign my name

I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing light settled deep in my brain

But by the time we met
By the time we met the times had already changed

So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart, I never wrote it down

So when the lights cut out
I was lost standing in the wilderness downtown

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

Now it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive

We used to wait
We used to waste hours just walking around
We used to wait
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown

We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
I'm still moving through the pain

I'm gonna write
A letter to my true love
I'm gonna sign my name

Like a patient on a table
I wanna walk again
Gonna move through the pain

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
I'm still moving through the pain
We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait

We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now they're screaming "sing the chorus again! "

We used to wait for it.
We used to wait for it.
Now we're screaming "sing the chorus again! "

I used to wait for it
I used to wait for it
Hear my voice screaming "sing the chorus again! "

Wait for it!
Wait for it!
Wait for it!

Took a drive into the sprawl
To find the house where we used to stay
Couldn't read the number in the dark
You said let's save it for another day

Took a drive into the sprawl
To find the places we used to play
It was the loneliest day of my life
You're talking at me but I'm still far away

Let's take a drive
Through the sprawl
Through these towns they built to change
Then you said, the emotions are dead
It's no wonder that you feel so strange

Cops shone their lights
On the reflectors of our bikes
Said, do you kids know what time it is?
Well sir, it's the first time I've felt like something is mine
Like I have something to give
The last defender of the sprawl
Said, well where do you kids live?
Well sir, if you only knew
What the answer is worth
Been searching every corner
Of the earth

They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
These days my life, I feel it has no purpose
But late at night the feelings swim to the surface

'Cause on the surface the city lights shine
They're calling at me, come and find your kind
Sometimes I wonder if the World's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

We rode our bikes to the nearest park
Sat under the swings and kissed in the dark
We shield our eyes from the police lights
We run away, but we don't know why
Black river, your city lights shine
They're screaming at us, we don't need your kind
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
Can we ever get away from the sprawl?
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

If I could have it back
All the time that we wasted
I'd only waste it again
If I could have it back
You know I'd love to waste it again
Waste it again and again and again

I've got to ask
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again
Sometimes I can't believe it...

Now the future's staring at me
like a vision from the past,
and I know these crumbs they sold me,
they're never gonna last.
Though we know the culture war,
we don't know what it's for but
we've lived the southern strategy.
You know it's never gonna last,
so keep it in the past.

These are different times that we're living in.
These are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast.
Paying for our crimes.

You left while I was sleepin'.
You said, "It's down to me".
Oh I've read a little Bible.
You see what you want to see.
Oh, we know the culture war,
we don't know what it's for but
we've lived your southern strategy.
You know it's never gonna last
so keep that shit in the past.

These are different times that we're living in.
'Cause these are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast.
They're paying for our crimes.

The dominos they never fell
but bodies they still burn.
Throw my hand into the fire
but still I never learn,
will I ever learn?

That these are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast
and paying for our crimes.
We'll be soldiers for you, mommy and daddy,
in your culture war.
We'll be soldiers for you, mommy and daddy,
but we don't know what it's for.

We're soldiers now in the culture war.
We're soldiers now, but we don't know what it's for.
We're soldiers now in the culture war.
We're soldiers now, but we don't know what it's for.
So tell me what's it for.

You want it? You got it, here's your culture war.
You want it? Now you've got it, so tell me what's it for.

Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Your daddy really took it out of you

But did he speak it in tongues?
But did he speak it in tongues?

Sneaking out the windows now

You've got the spirit now

Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Where did we lose our way?

It's like we're speaking in tongues
It's like we're speaking in tongues

Sneaking out the windows now

You've got the spirit now
You've got the spirit now
You've got the spirit now

Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Now I can't understand a word

Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)
Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)
Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)
Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)

Come out of your head
And into my world now

Come out of your head
And into my world, my world, my world now

(Speaking in tongues)
(To end)

Trapped in a prism, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume, des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there
I don't care

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're still connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre les voyants, les vivants et les morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
Because you're my home

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
Will I see you on the other side?
We all got things to hide
It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
Will I see you on the other side?
We all got things to hide

All right, let's go back
Our song escapes on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me?
Down, down, down
Don't mess around

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)

It’s a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
Will I see you on the other side?
It’s just a Reflektor
Will I see you on the other side?
We all got things to hide
It’s just a Reflektor
Will I see you on the other side?

Walking around head full of sound
Acting like we don't exist
Walk in a room stare out through you
Talking like we don't exist

But we exist

Daddy it's true, I'm different from you
But tell me why they treat me like this?
You turn away, what could I say
Not the first betrayed by a kiss

Maybe it's true
They're staring at you
When you walk in a room

Turn on us fine
Stare if you like
Or just let us through
Just let us through

Down on your knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist

Daddy it's fine, I'm used to them now
But tell me why they treat me like this?
Is it because we do it like this?

Maybe it's true
They're staring at you
When you walk in a room

Turn on us fine
Stare if you like
Or just let us through
Just let us through

Let them stare
Let them stare
That's all right with you

But lose myself
If it turn away from you

Daddy told him to wait
Mother, I'm so scared
But will you watch us drown?
You know that they will

You know that we're young
You know that we're confused
But will you watch us drown?
What are you so afraid to lose?

Down on their knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist

We exist

[Verse]
What if the camera
Really do
Take your soul
Oh no
What if the camera
Really do
Take your soul
Oh no

[Chorus]
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes!
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes!
You know I've got nothing to hide
You know I got nothing
No I got... nothing

[Verse]

[Chorus x2]

When the sun goes down,
When the sun goes down you head inside
Because the lights don't work,
Nothing works but you don't mind

Here comes the night time

The missionaries tell us we will be left behind
Been left behind a thousand times, a thousand times
If you want to be righteous, if you want to be righteous
Get in line
Here comes the night time

Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time
Now here comes the night
Here comes the night
Look out here comes the night time

They say heaven's a place, yeah heaven's a place
And they know where it is,
But you know where it is?
It's behind the gate, they won't let you in
When they hear the beat coming from the street the lock the door,
If there's no music up in heaven then what's it for?
When I hear the beat, my spirit's on like a live wire
A thousand horses running wild in a city on fire
It starts in your feet, then it goes to your head
And if you can feel it, then the rules are dead
And if you're the judge, then what is our crime?
Here comes the night time.

Now the preachers they talk
[?]
If you're looking for hell, just try looking inside

When you look in the sky, just try looking inside
God knows what you might find
Here comes the night time

Is anything as strange as a normal person?
Is anyone as cruel as a normal person?
Waiting after school, you want to know if you're normal too
Well, are you?

I'm so confused, am I a normal person?
You know, I can't tell if I'm a normal person, it's true
I think I'm cool enough, but am I cruel enough...
Am I cruel enough... for you?

Break it down until everything is normal now
I know

Take their tea at two, all the normal people, they do
They burned the jungle down, while you were sleeping it grew
You dream in English now, in proper English
Look how you're just the same as me
It's through!

If that's what's normal now, I don't want to know!
Mama, don't make me go!

When they get excited they try to hide it (...No!)
Look at those normals go!

If that's what's normal now, I don't want to know
If that's what's normal now...

Maybe if you have together, you can make the changes in our hearts
And if you hang together, you can change us, just where should you start?

I've never really ever met a normal person (...like you)

How do you do?

[Intro sample]
Arcade Fire!

[Verse 1]
Sometimes it moves so fast
Sometimes it moves so fast
If you stop to ask
It's already passed
So how can you move so slow?
How can you move so slow?
You miss it if you don't
You miss it if you

[Chorus]
Don't already know
Already know
Already know
Already know
Already know

[Verse 2]
When your love is right
When your love is right
You can't sleep at night
You've been sleeping just fine
But when your love is bad
When your love is bad
I don't know why you're so sad
But it's time to go

[Chorus]
You already know
Already know
You already know
You already know
You already know
You already know
Already know

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it moves so fast
Sometimes it moves so fast
If you stop to ask
It's already passed
So how can you move so slow?
How can you move so slow?
You missed it, you know
You missed it

[Chorus]
You already know
Already know
You already know
You already know

[Bridge]
Please stop wondering why you feel so bad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so sad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so bad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so sad
When you already know
(Already know)

[Outro]
You already know
Oh, it's time to go

She said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I know?"
(You already know)

Well then he said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I know?"
(You already know)

She said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I know?"...

[Outro sample]
Haha, haha
Arcade Fire, ladies and gentlemen!

You're the one that they used to hate
But they like you now
And everything that goes away
Will be returned somehow
They're the ones that spit on you
Cause they got no heart
I'm the one that will follow you
You're my Joan of Arc

Joan of Arc

You had a vision they couldn't see so
They put you down
But everything that you said would happen
It came around
And they're the ones that put you down
Cause they got no heart
But I'm the one that will follow you
You're my Joan of Arc

[Chorus 1]
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc)
Tell the boys their time is through
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
I'll follow you

Now they tell you that you're their muse
Yeah, they're so inspired
But where were they when they called your name
And they lit the fire?
When the voices came, you cut your hair
But you're still confused
But I'm the one with a heavy heart
Cause I'll follow you

[Chorus 2]
My Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys their time is through
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
When the boys are over you
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
I'll follow you

I really wanna know you

[Regine Chassagne]
Tu dis que tu est mon juge
Mais je ne te crois pas
Alors tu dis que je suis une sainte
Mais ce n'est pas moi
J'entends des voix
Mais ce n'est pas moi
Je ne suis pas Jeanne d'Arc
And if you shoot you better hit your mark

[Chorus 2]

Joan, it's true
I only wanna know you
Joan, it's true, it's true
I only wanna know you
But Joan
I only wanna know you

First they love you
Then they kill you
Then they love you again
And then they love you
Then they kill you
Then they love you again
Love love love you
Kill kill kill you
And then they love you again
They love love love you
Kill kill kill you
And then they love you again

Here comes the night time

I hurt myself again
So low we go, my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again

Here comes the night time

You hurt yourself again
How low we go, my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again

Here comes the night time coming on slow
Here comes the night time, I know that you know
Here comes the night time

Well, I hurt myself again
How low we go, my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again

Here comes the night time

You and I were born in a little town
Before the awful sound started coming down
Oh no, oh

You came home from school and knew you had to run
Please stop running now, just let me be the one for you
I know you can see things that we can't see
But when I say I love you, your silence covers me
Oh, Eurydice, it's an awful sound

I was so disappointed you didn't want me
Oh, how could it be, Eurydice?
I was standing beside you by a frozen sea
Will you ever get free?

Just take all your pain, just put it on me
So that you can breathe
When you fly away will you hit the ground?
It's an awful sound

I know there's a way, we can make them pay
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again"
I know there's a way, we can leave today
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again"

You were born in the little town
Before the awful sound started coming down
There's so much inside you that you won't let me see
You fly away from me, but it's an awful sound when you hit the ground
It's an awful sound when you hit the ground

I know there's a way, we can make them pay
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again"
I know there's a way, we can leave today
Think it over

We know there's a price to pay for love in a reflective age
I met you up upon a stage, our love in a reflective age
Oh no, now you're gone

Hey, Orpheus!
I'm behind you
Don't turn around
I can find you

Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
And if I call for you
Oh, Orpheus!
Just sing for me all night
We'll wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

You say it's not me, it's you

Hey, Orpheus!
De l'autre côté de l'eau
Comme un écho
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

And if I shout for you
Never doubt
Don't turn around too soon
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

It seems so important now
But you will get over
It seems so important now
But you will get over
And when you get over
When you get older
Then you will remember
Why it was so important then

Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
When you get over
And when you get older
Then you will discover
That it's never over

Hey, Eurydice!
Can you see me?
I will sing your name
Till you're sick of me
Just wait until it's over
Just wait until it's through

But if you call for me
This frozen sea
It melts beneath me
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
And when you get over
And when you get older
Then you will remember

He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
Now that it's over
Now that you're older
Then you will discover
That it's never over

It's never over (it's never over) [8x]

Sometime (Sometime)
Sometime (Sometime)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (eat you alive)
But it's never gonna happen now
We'll figure it out somehow

Sometime (Sometime)
Sometime (Sometime)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (eat you alive)
But it's never gonna happen now
We'll figure it out somehow

Cause it's never over
It's never over (it's never over) [6x]

We stood beside
A frozen sea
I saw you out
In front of me
Reflected light
A hollow moon
Oh Orphes, Eurydice
Its over too soon

Take the makeup off your eyes
I've got to see you, hear your sacred sighs
Before the break up, comes the silence
I'm talking to you. You say you're over it,
But I know

I thought I knew you. You thought you knew me
But now that you do, it's not so easy now
That I know

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Every man that you know would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno, oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know what we know. Never know what we know

And all your makeup, just take it all off
I've got to find you before the line is lost
I know I hurt you, I won't deny it
When I reach for you, you say, "I'm over it."
But I know

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Every man that you know would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno, oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know what I know. It's so little that we know
But the cup it overflows. Little boys with their porno
This is their world, where can we go?

Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Can you see me?

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Little boys with their porno. Little boys with their porno
Makes me feel like something's wrong. It's the only world we know
Yeah, something's wrong. Little boys with their porno

And boys they learn some selfish shit until the girl won't put up with it
On and on and on we go. I just have to know. I'm not over it
I'm not over it

So love is real like a disease. 
Come on tell me please, 
I'm not over it
I'm not over it

Afterlife. Oh my God, what an awful word
After all the breath and the dirt and the fires are burnt.
And after all this time, and after all the ambulances go
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on in the dead lights
Of the afterglowI’ve gotta know… Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout ’till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout ’till we work it out
’till we work it out, ’till we work it out
’till we work it out, ’till we work it out

Afterlife. I think I saw what happens next
Oh, it was just a glimpse of you, like looking through a window
Or a shallow sea
Could you see me?
And after all this time
It’s like nothing else we used to know
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on in the dead lights
Of the afterglow

I’ve gotta know…

Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout ’till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout ’till we work it out?

But you say “Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?”
And you say
“Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?”
And where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

And after this
Can it last another night?
After all the bad advice
That had nothing at all to do with life

I’ve gotta know

Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout ’till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout ’till we work it out?

But you say
“Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?”
And you say
“Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?”
We know it’s gone
But where did it go?
And where do we go?

Is this the afterlife?
It’s just an afterlife with you.
It’s just an afterlife.
It’s just an afterlife.
It’s just an afterlife with you.
It’s just an afterlife.
It’s just an afterlife.

I know you're living in my mind
It's not the same as being alive
I know you're living in my mind
It's not the same as being alive

Wanna feel the seasons passing

I don't know where, but you're not with me
Heard a voice, like an echo
But it came from you
